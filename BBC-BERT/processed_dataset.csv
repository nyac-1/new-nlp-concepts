term and urban music in truth lazy term categorise music really understand soul garage worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam doubt connections if let music speak judge success artist number

government needs provide facilities young groups bands form practise the equipment cheap well beyond means many people however i feel extent role provide conditions talent flourish let go i agree government help fund music also responsibility held record companies they generally always opt tried tested tend want break moulds risk losing money ultimately directors business if labels willing put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts government would fork great deal yeah music government funded particularly work modern composers veteran bands artists stuff pop music pretty much rules earth attention go fraternities i agree funding arts make accessible public i convinced pop music requires financial support taxpayer there great deal money generated pop music perhaps tax pop could ploughed public performance forms music everyone enjoy perhaps could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music music industry sector without artistic merit originality whatsoever specifically designed line pockets music producers call tax music pollution like though i really like franz ferdinand i disagree mr kapranos once government gets hand private sector destroy creative

i speechless best song last 25 years yeah right i much doubt angels even best song week came like every track robbie released single blatant poor facsimile something someone else done better give us break best song 25 years must joking its good like sort thing really listened angels radio 1 morning i driving work had heard i love robs voice lyrics tune perfection as usual public short memories comes voting greatest there must dozen songs last 25 years deserve award it exactly groundbreaking presumably age range could bothered vote pretty low i actually embarrassed british best song produced last 25 years what the specials ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen love with someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear us apart angels middle road rubbish angels awful piece sentimental claptrap it musically lyrically inept fantastically overrated bit like mr williams this result surprising though the brits long history celebrating rubbish music best last 25 years maybe cunning make timescale include stairway heaven bohemian rhapsody kind make bit hollow award really not much competition last 25 years it alright pop song best song last 25 years there way earth song voted best last 25 years travesty rubbish who voted included list i regular listener radio 2 i recall invitation vote bland slushy rubbish might appeal masses would know good song jumped bit nose certainly not best song last 25 years how depressing thought manufactured pop way earth dreadful list appear while i biassed i thought love will tear us apart seriousness i think best song last 25 years include songs less 5 years old would exclude songs popular novelty then well done robbie good show you got kidding angels great song best song last 25 years only best song nomination brits i think angels great song deserved run award i think best song past 25 years right enough better others catergory example will young nominated first place alright song good i happy robbie though best song last 25 years what joke think great rock pop songs released 80 pretty much better angels phil collins deserve awards good songs wrote angels overrated song got tiresome even finished listening soppy rubbish best hopefully manufactured rubbish die soon let real artists worked hard glory receive awards so boringly obvious typical bland nature mainstream music britain today proof music democracy mix still least will young oh bit fun people take awards seriously robbie millions loyal fans even non fans know words angels him winning obviously reflects votes awards personally i wanted will young win really due musical talent i hate song brings back memories school discos one slow dance i agree angels i never get fed hearing whenever song comes radio i turn radio smile sing along badly radio turned drown voice the song makes calm serene happy well done robbie i think although robbie williams good performer angels really good song it certainly anywhere near good love will tear us apart joy division wuthering heights kate bush angels fantastic song all credit robbie williams guy chambers it song played forever bridges age groups robbie way deserve mantle whenever awards always artists past five years seem win best best we forget late 80 early 90 example they cool time cool shows songs greater longevity people think yes angels best song since past 25 years touches soul carries lot meaning i always disliked angels intensely i believe symbolic general capacity british pre teens teens middle aged women accept low quality low aspirational music classic songwriting it orrible it seems obvious people like robbie people particularly like music much folks without collections folks never engaged madness one experiences falling spell pop music angels adds nothing merely irritating distraction wasp refuses go away summer afternoon picnic what dreadful result if voted feel ashamed probably know dozen songs get applying uninformed filter casting ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song you kidding right last five years i might willing accept 25 way did whoever voted actually any music knowledge prior say 1995 really quite insulting british music industry past quarter century no surprise robbie williams considering list where earth nominations list come compiled eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come what load crap best song last 25 years i think what real artists last 25 years list endless robbie williams even come close what joke that song become bane i developed pavlovian response word angels i thrash around scream someone tells radio why half baked cheesy ditty like angels become anthem millions romantic sops think many times sung pop idol example voted best song past 25 years beyond if song others judged musicians may well give why reward mediocrity highly country the initial list weak anyway angels best song last 25 years i think i realize radio 2 many listeners age 10 people short memories a great song yes best last 25 years not chance i think person opposed song voted the great british public work it mediocre sentimental safe song granted bad either but stand anything the smiths particular how soon now anything stone roses first album nope no because i female i 10 ok i like robbie angels decent song but way best song past 25 years the shortlist great winning joke predictable laughable the success angels years brits reflects poorly state british music last 25 years the british public brainwashed corporate pulp presneted cutting edge music true talent sadly missed whilst angels popular song even best song robbie repertoire never mind best song last 25 years i huge robbie fan love song but i think lot outstanding songs music influenced music today unfortunately left list have radio 2 listeners even heard joy division a band two albums bigger impact music continue last 25 years robbie williams ever no doubt there song done anyone emotion feeling some people adopt slightly snobby stances angels hit home far larger audience song it joy division those guys played influential part shaping modern day music angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely believe 25 years influential artists argue robbie williams inspired art way byrds beatles nick drake done music today yes i think brilliantly written song different meanings different people there great songs category somebody win robbie deserved winner i astounded second rate record beaten line amazing songs terrible song voted masses brains appreciate innovative exciting music the best song past 25 years really come surely joke no i think i need long lie it goes show british public clue good quality music pick robbie williams beautifully talented kate bush joy division i suppose confirmed one thing british public consistently dull lt no offence robbie pleeease there must thousand better songs formulated cheesy pop song kids no one agrees quite frankly embarassment integrity british music nail coffin i think robbie deserves iconic stars britain since john lennon idol millions worldwide anybody says deserve jealous success the real challenger queen hey another one bites dust obviously karaoke singers uk voted if best song last 25 years british music industry trouble sure robbie talented produces excellent material best record a sad day music it type music i normally like even diehard rock fan i recognise good song appelas people that voted best song last 25 years it good rounder just like robbie best song 25 years since 1980 i confused angels bad song it nice catchy formulaic anthem ticks boxes but great music if anything regressive bland even i suppose evidence redundant brit awards become granted angels good song however really proper competition the queen song lackluster apart kate bush choices pathetic also stones david bowie etc many greater songs angels i wonder simply fact robbie getting awards make one best song last 25 years what ridiculuous concept even ridiculous winner sigh on upside least bohemian rhapsody thankful angels without doubt great song i really think deserves title best song 25 years perhaps vote teenage opinion robbies goodlooks actual song do get wrong i disputing looks deserved winners it would travesty angels without angels robbie williams may well britain would deprived one charismatic talented performing artists it seen performed live 125 000 people singing along fully appreciated well done rob i find hard believe angels best show past 25 years i rapidly redifining best head mean amost gratuitously played weddings funerals people think deep meaning what britpop blur oasis suede pulp making fantastic songs also making changes something different why must best always come commercially popular i nothing robbie i actually like music possibly best song last 25 year the brits proved nothing bargaining tool pop moguls boost band profiles record sales the goes scissor sisters i think superb record thoroughly deserves newcomer award album comes near u 2 new record neither league once baffling discisions made artisic reasons profit no surprise really voted general public since taste music personally i find angels robbie williams one irritating songs i ever heard it absolutely deserved win it song united generations continue played many years come it absolute joke however original 25 poor choices well all pretty pointless exercise the song overplayed oversentimental out rather poor five choices left gone either joy division queen i suppose thankful end hands will young though although nostalgia value way deserved win everybody knows words bohemian rhapsody nothing compares 2 u etc much better songs timeless give someone real talent although angels good song i think anyone slightest musical

day terrorists willing things predecessors that mean civil liberties modern britain must eroded counter threat always absolute last resort but meet new threat defeat sinister fanaticism today terrorists may need things little differently let us hope frederic forsythe comments seem well thought analysis human society whole britain particular resist temptation protect fear it fear enables terrorists succeed end terrorists come forms mr forsythe opening comments suggest i reminded quote attributed thomas jefferson a nation limits freedom name security neither the government faced incredibly difficult task made policy deal it well criticising policy mr forsythe draw years experience offer alternative i say so opinions frederick forsyth rhetoric absurd conclusions laughable he distorts reality serve prejudice new labour this government seeks balance protection democracy minimum loss civil rights it frederick forsyth extremist appreciate need balance i rarely find agreeing my forsyth instance i think correct the rule law must prevail civil liberties worth defending if government hold isuspects without charge trial next i agree absolutely by introducing fascist type laws loose moral high ground fight terror our democratic system perfect churchill points better others tried terrorist attacks take place many reasons take personal risk return personal freedom i usually agree mr forsyth spot the single biggest threat face government dedicated acting illegally manipulating international national law suit purpose totalitarianism always requires outside threat justifying range extraordinary powers leaders want the british government far greater threat terrorist organisation although principle i agree frederick forsyth fails address one key point al qaeda attacks though obviously none yet uk seek kill maximum number people the ira wanted limit death toll attacks maintain support among republican movement yes i agree mr forsyth views i believe government plans justified there reaction negative influence us president interpretation democracy freedom he uses arguments current wwii wars liberate iraq afghanistan syria iran come we leaving poor inheritance future generations mr forsyth wonderful writer keep fiction belongs the british government going road mr forsyth suggests sadly comments make lot people believe governed people fast becoming tyrants instead genuinely committed stopping tyranny even method employed moment alien british people lived democracy protected tony blair others like mind mr forsyth seems putting along side iscruffy little austrian thomas hobbes would smiling grave labour propositions like new labour called libertarian like new labour believed promoting people best interests but forsythe criticises government hobbes criticised subsequent philosophers arguing way hands totalitarians simply put argued favour ultimate liberty liberty live man prepared surrender liberties supreme sovereign protection fellow barbaric man hobbes roundly condemned posterity rightly i hope new labour suffers treatment i agree mr forsyth views the governments approach totally spirit british democracy they must allowed get away of course frederick wrong britain winning war ira wrong country becoming tyranny has forgotten shoot kill torture internment without trial collusion loyalist death squads etc my background somewhat similar freddie i persuaded agree many sentiments we moral justification imposing system government anyone systematically depriving citizens basic individual collective freedoms whilst principle keeping potential terrorists house arrest might seem superficially attractive unfortunately also first step towards totalitarianism who decide suspect why believe who faith honesty integrity competence intelligence services politicians light events recent years what stop false denunciations what falsely accused lose careers who support families will children still go school it smacks methods nazi germany stalin russia ceausescu romania list goes it looks new dark age coming i see opinion mr forsyth remarks divided the problem i see support imprisonment without trial believe never happen family people like scared but history shown laws like always get abused power after today may scared people power someday power may scared and day one imprisoned without chance justice our laws cannot imprisoned whim police forces shown deserving if imprison people without trial indeterminate period better fighting i never thought possible agree single word uttered frederick forsyth i wholehearted agreement one we nation grave danger duped pro us propaganda course also means inherit total paranoia allow governments political persuasion incidentally gradually insidiously impose police state well tried tested back door methods i grieve future children wonder adamant ever want this government much fanfare signs us european convention human rights wants introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this puts par government burma like many respondents i would usually think mr forsyth someone whose views i share instance opposing charles clark proposals house arrest i agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth i agree mr forsyth just look facts government along us invaded another sovereign country iraq selecting intelligence backed case based fear the facts turned different if individuals treated distorted way done damage terrorist organisation could bombs we become animals i agree many ways mr forsyth said respected influence within world must seen walking walk well talking talk accuse countries zimbabwe burma human rights abuses locking people may totally innocent hypocrisy highest order mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism new threat however appears misunderstood term islamic fundamentalism it pointed muslim adheres true fundamentals qur aan teachings last prophet muhammad islamic fundamentalist this person commit suicide shape form kill innocent women men children this person self reflective constantly tries better actions good others the people mr forsyth labels new threat follow correct teachings islam they arrived interpretations assumptions regards actions on top claim following islam true form i accept intentions policies make britain safer place i cannot think single example history sort thing ever made difference northern ireland internment certainly achieve anything bombings stop could argued achieved supply ira yet angry resentful republicans willing take arms british being eight years older frederick forsyth survivor blitz london easy agree absolutely spot during ira bombings massive explosions canary wharf right i write also left city london notwithstanding attempted nearly successful assassination attempts prime minister thatcher brighton later occupants 10 downing street retaliatory blitz belfast dublin afghanistan iraq even england true peril 1940 apart detentions wholesale derogation habeas corpus like we see latest attempts liberties including id cards winston churchill decided go since said average bobby beat could relied tempted take undue advantage citizen going lawful activities incidentally i still remember old id card number hence clear far great police state powers set statute books resisted neutered what i add mr forsyth eloquently put arguments except applause well done
